        In January of 2015, during a month long business trip to India, the <a href="http://www.wanderingburgers.com">WanderingBurgers</a> finally put the wheels in motion <i>(ha! get it!)</i>
         After two years of dreaming of living the full-time RV lifestyle, facebook stalking some of the well known fulltimers and doing little to further that dream, we decided to put our full weight and attention to making the dream a reality. From the momment we landed back in the US we would dedicate every night, every weekend to getting there as fast as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        Having one half of the <a href="http://www.wanderingburgers.com">WanderingBurgers</a> as a software engineer with 15+ years experience, we decided it would only be an honest, complete lifestyle change if it also included transitioning our means to a financial end to also be travel related.
    </p>
    <p>In previous circumstances, income generating decions had far less to do with what "made us happy" and far more to do with the continuation of the hedonic treadmill we, and most Americans were on. It took time to think outside this box, but after much thought, discussion, debate, sleepless nights, BoonDockr became a clear path forward.</p>
    <p>In the previous two years we had spent almost every weekend and every vacation day we had air-streaming, but there was a problem: Staying in RV parks was not what we wanted out of rv'ing. Sure, having a swimming pool was cool sometimes, it just wasnt the dream. We loved staying in the most rural, off the beaten path locations, but found ourselves spending a lot of time researching good boon-docking locations with little success. In a few instances the information we received was so wrong we got stuck in the snow with no way to turn around for two days. We went down a road to a BLM site that no longer existed. We damaged the bottom of our airstream on a far too-rutted dirt road. Was it really this hard? Sure, there were one-off reviews and sites with user contributed boon-docking info but it was so inconsistent it could never be trusted.</p>
    <p>We ended up getting really good at finding sites and doing research, calling BLM offices, inspecting maps, unhitching the trailer and reconning potential campsites, all while seeing endless posts from other rv'ers wanting to experience the wilds, but not willing (for good reason) to do the amount of leg work it required.</p>
    <p class="lead">So that's where BoonDockr.com comes in! We've fallen in love with the research, with the data, with the details. It's never once has been seen as a means to an end.</p>
    <p><strong>We have one simple, transparent mission statement for BoonDockr:</strong></p>
    <p class="lead"><i>"Provide consistent, detailed, accurate information about boon-docking campsites around the country."</i></p>
    <p>we work hard to provide as many new listing every month as possible but quality always comes before quantity.</p>
